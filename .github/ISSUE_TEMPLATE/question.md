## What do you need help with?
Hi I recently downloaded the Aristois hacked client and saw that you were one of the developers of "Fabritone". One issue I am having is how I am supposed to use the Schematics feature. I can't find any current version of the mod or a tutorial. Please help.

## Final checklist
- [x] I know how to properly use check boxes 
- [ ] I have not used any OwO's or UwU's in this issue.
